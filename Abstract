Automatic Room Light Control:-

When we enter a room, as a habitual tendency, we often search for a switch to turn the light on,
and if we are new to the room, we often find it difficult to locate the switch. Most of the times, 
many of us forget to switch off the lights while leaving the room in which we stay most of the time.
This results in unnecessary power wastage. Therefore, an automatic room-light controller automatically 
turns on the lights when a person enters into a room, and turns off the lights when the person leaves 
the room. This automatic room controller can be implemented by using a simple microcontroller and 
wireless IR technologies.
