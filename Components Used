• Microcontroller Atmega328p
  ATMEGA328P is high performance, low power controller from Microchip. ATMEGA328P is an 8-bit
  microcontroller based on AVR RISC architecture. It is the most popular of all AVR controllers.


• Ultrasonic Sensor
  It is used to measure the distance between objects.


• Bread Board
  A breadboard is used to build and test circuits quickly before finalizing any circuit design.

• Jumping Wires
  A jump wire (also known as jumper wire, or jumper) is an electrical wire, or group of them in a
  cable, with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them – simply "tinned"), which is 
  normally used to interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit,
  internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.

• PIR Motion Sensor
  It is used to detect the motion of any object.

• LDR
  It detects the light and darkness in the room.


• Alphanumeric Display
  It is used to display the occurring function.


• Relay Module
  The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts,
  or combinations thereof. Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by an independent low-power
  signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal.


• Led Bulb
  Led bulb is used to ignite the lignite.


• Bulb Holder
  Bulb Holder is used to hold the Bulb.
