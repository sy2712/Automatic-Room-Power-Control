Nowadays without electricity we cannot imagine our daily life because electricity has become a necessity for all, without which day-to-day life chores &amp; daily activities become stand still. Due to the depletion of non-renewable resources, conservation of energy has become mandatory and by doing so we can reduce electricity bills as well. We know that energies like wind energy, solar energy and hydro energy are called renewable energy sources which are renewable in nature. Therefore, utilization of these resources for power supply is the best possible way of producing, conserving and renewing energy, which is advantageous as it is pollution free, affordable, and free from environmental impacts.
